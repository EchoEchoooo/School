Functions
Mint Tokens:

solidity
Copy code
mint(address, value);
Example: mint(0x123..., 100); will mint 100 tokens to the specified address, increasing the total supply.
Burn Tokens:

solidity
Copy code
burn(address, value);
Example: burn(0x123..., 50); will burn 50 tokens from the specified address, reducing the total supply (if the address has enough tokens).
